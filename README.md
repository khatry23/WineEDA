# WineEDA
This dataset was provided by UCI Machine Learning repository, which proved upon preliminary filtering that it has been cleaned to a large level for refined purposes as opposed to otherwise available data. There were no null values in dataset when it was filtered for the same.
But, to improve our understanding of the roll out for further processing, I added a new variable for wine quality to determine based on rating, whether the wine will be Good or Bad.
Wines that were given a rating > 7 were placed as Good, while those below that scale were rated Bad with Average between 4 and 6.
To explore the distributions, we can look at our explanatory variables.
